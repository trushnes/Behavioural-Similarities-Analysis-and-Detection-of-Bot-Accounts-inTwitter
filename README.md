# Behavioural-Similarities-Analysis-and-Detection-of-Bot-Accounts-inTwitter

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available on request on the mail: fakeproject@iit.cnr.it

### Steps to Execute the Project
Step 1. Upload file “DNA_Seq _Generation.ipynb” code file on Google-colab. This file will generate the DNA Sequences and Longest Common Subsequence which are stored in .csv
files. Change the data file paths as required. The dataset used in this file can be accessed by requesting on the mail provided.

Step 2. Upload “Behavioural_Analysis.ipynb” code file on Google-colab. Provide the data file paths generated with the help of “DNA_Seq_Generation.ipynb” code file, wherever necessary.

Step 3. Upload “Twitter_Bot_Detection.ipynb” code file on Google-colab and provide the appropriate data file path and execute the code to see the bot detection model implementation.
